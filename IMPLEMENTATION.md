## Frontend Implementation Plan

This plan maps the existing Convex + Next.js + Clerk backend to a complete
frontend. Tasks are grouped by milestone and include checkboxes you can use
to track progress.

### Assumptions
- [ ] Keep Clerk for auth and Convex as the data layer
- [ ] Use App Router and Tailwind for styling
- [ ] Introduce `src/features/*` for feature code; pages live in `app/*`
- [ ] Public storefront is browseable without auth; checkout/order history
      requires auth

### Early adjustments (do first)
- [x] Update `middleware.ts` public routes to allow unauthenticated access:
      `/`, `/c/(.*)`, `/p/(.*)`, `/search`
- [x] Replace landing content with a storefront home (remove upload example)
- [ ] Ensure required env vars are set: `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`, Clerk keys,
      any R2 bucket settings

### Directory setup (non-breaking)
- [ ] Create feature folders:
  - [x] `src/features/common` (layout, shell, pagination, filter UI, toasts)
  - [x] `src/features/products` (grid, cards, detail, filters)
  - [x] `src/features/categories` (nav, tree, grid)
  - [x] `src/features/cart` (drawer/page, line items)
  - [x] `src/features/checkout` (review, place order)
  - [x] `src/features/orders` (list, details)
  - [ ] `src/features/account` (profile, preferences)
  - [ ] `src/features/admin` (shell, products, categories, orders, analytics)
  - [ ] `src/features/super-admin` (shell, orgs, users, permissions, logs, analytics)

### Milestone 1: Foundation and shell
- [x] Build shared shell in `app/layout.tsx` using:
  - [x] `SiteHeader` (logo, search, category nav, cart badge, auth menu)
  - [x] `SiteFooter`
  - [ ] Optional `ThemeProvider` and `Toaster`
- [ ] Hook cart badge to `carts.queries.getCartSummary` (or `getCartByUser`)
