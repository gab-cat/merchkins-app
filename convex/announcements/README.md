# Announcements Domain

This domain manages system and organization announcements with scheduling, pinning, targeting, acknowledgments, and analytics.

## Features
- Create/update announcements with optional organization scope
- Scheduling (publish now or later) and expiry
- Target audiences (ALL, STAFF, CUSTOMERS, MERCHANTS, ADMINS)
- Pin/unpin, activate/deactivate (soft delete)
- User acknowledgments (idempotent) and engagement stats (views, clicks, dismiss)
- Robust permission checks leveraging organization permissions and system admin fallback

## Permissions
- Organization-scoped announcements require `MANAGE_ANNOUNCEMENTS` in that organization
- Global announcements (no organization) require system admin
