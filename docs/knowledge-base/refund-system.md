# Handling Refunds

## The Golden Rule: Vouchers, Not Cash

At our platform, **all refunds are issued as store credit vouchers**. We do not process cash or card reversals.

**Why?** This keeps money within the ecosystem and protects you (the seller) from losing revenue instantly.

## How the Refund Process Works

1.  **Customer Requests Refund:** A customer can request a refund within **24 hours** of making a payment.
2.  **You Review It:** You will see the request in your Admin Dashboard.
3.  **Approve or Reject:**
    - **If Approved:** The system _automatically_ creates a **Refund Voucher** for the customer.
    - **If Rejected:** The order continues as normal.

## The Refund Voucher

When you approve a refund, the customer receives a **Refund Voucher**.

- **Value:** Equal to the exact amount they paid.
- **Where to use:** They can use this voucher to buy again from your store _or_ any other store on the platform.
- **Validity:** It never expires.

## IMPORTANT: How Refunds Affect Your Payout

This is the most common question from sellers.

### Scenario A: Refund BEFORE Payout

If you approve a refund _before_ the weekly payout is generated (before Wednesday):

- That order is simply removed from your payout calculation.
- You receive **₱0** for that order.

### Scenario B: Refund AFTER Payout

If you approve a refund _after_ you have already been paid for that order:

- We cannot take the money back from your bank account.
- Instead, we create a negative **Adjustment** on your _next_ payout.
- **Example:** You were paid ₱1,000 last week. Today you refund that order. Next week's payout will be deducted by ₱1,000.

## Common Questions

### What happens if a customer uses a Refund Voucher at my store?

Treat it exactly like cash! You will receive your full payout (minus the standard platform fee). The platform covers the cost of the voucher.

### Can I give a partial refund?

No. Currently, the system only supports **full refunds** for the entire order.

### Can a customer request a refund after 24 hours?

The system blocks requests after 24 hours. However, you can personally choose to coordinate with the customer offline if you wish, but official platform refunds are closed.
