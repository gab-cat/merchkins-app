# Handling Refunds

## The Golden Rule: Vouchers First, Monetary Refunds Available for Seller-Initiated Cancellations

At our platform, **refunds are issued as store credit vouchers**. The refund method depends on who initiated the cancellation:

- **Customer-initiated cancellations:** Refunds are issued exclusively as platform vouchers. Cash refunds are not available.
- **Seller-initiated cancellations:** Refunds are initially issued as platform vouchers. However, customers can request a monetary refund after 14 days from the voucher issuance date.

**Why vouchers first?** This keeps money within the ecosystem and protects you (the seller) from losing revenue instantly. For seller-initiated cancellations, the option for monetary refunds after a waiting period provides additional consumer protection.

## How the Refund Process Works

### Customer-Initiated Refunds

1.  **Customer Requests Refund:** A customer can request a refund within **24 hours** of making a payment.
2.  **You Review It:** You will see the request in your Admin Dashboard.
3.  **Approve or Reject:**
    - **If Approved:** The system _automatically_ creates a **Refund Voucher** for the customer. This voucher is voucher-only (no monetary refund option).
    - **If Rejected:** The order continues as normal.

### Seller-Initiated Cancellations

1.  **You Cancel a Paid Order:** When you cancel a paid order, the system _automatically_ creates a **Refund Voucher** for the customer.
2.  **14-Day Waiting Period:** The customer must wait 14 days from voucher issuance before they can request a monetary refund.
3.  **Monetary Refund Request:** After 14 days, the customer can request a monetary refund through their Vouchers page. Super-admins review and process these requests.

## The Refund Voucher

When a refund is approved or an order is cancelled, the customer receives a **Refund Voucher**.

- **Value:** Equal to the exact amount they paid.
- **Where to use:** They can use this voucher to buy again from your store _or_ any other store on the platform.
- **Validity:** It never expires.
- **Cancellation Type:** The voucher tracks whether it was issued from a customer-initiated or seller-initiated cancellation.
- **Monetary Refund Eligibility:** Only vouchers from seller-initiated cancellations are eligible for monetary refund requests (after 14 days).

## IMPORTANT: How Refunds Affect Your Payout

This is the most common question from sellers.

### Scenario A: Refund BEFORE Payout

If you approve a refund _before_ the weekly payout is generated (before Wednesday):

- That order is simply removed from your payout calculation.
- You receive **₱0** for that order.

### Scenario B: Refund AFTER Payout

If you approve a refund _after_ you have already been paid for that order:

- We cannot take the money back from your bank account.
- Instead, we create a negative **Adjustment** on your _next_ payout.
- **Example:** You were paid ₱1,000 last week. Today you refund that order. Next week's payout will be deducted by ₱1,000.

## Common Questions

### What happens if a customer uses a Refund Voucher at my store?

Treat it exactly like cash! You will receive your full payout (minus the standard platform fee). The platform covers the cost of the voucher.

### Can I give a partial refund?

No. Currently, the system only supports **full refunds** for the entire order.

### Can a customer request a refund after 24 hours?

The system blocks customer-initiated refund requests after 24 hours. However, you can personally choose to coordinate with the customer offline if you wish, but official platform refunds are closed.

### What happens when I cancel a paid order?

When you cancel a paid order, the customer automatically receives a refund voucher. After 14 days, they can request a monetary refund for this voucher through their Vouchers page. Super-admins handle these monetary refund requests.

### Can customers request monetary refunds for all vouchers?

No. Only vouchers issued from seller-initiated cancellations are eligible for monetary refund requests. Customer-initiated refund vouchers are voucher-only and cannot be converted to monetary refunds.
