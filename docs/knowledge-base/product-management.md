# Managing Your Products

## Overview

Your products are the heart of your store. This guide will help you create new products, manage inventory (Stock vs. Pre-order), and set up options like Size and Color.

## Stock vs. Pre-Order: What's the Difference?

When you create a product, you must choose an **Inventory Type**. This is very important!

### 1. STOCK (Standard)

- **What it means:** You have the items on hand or a specific limit.
- **How it works:** The system counts down your inventory every time a sale is made.
- **When to use:** Physical goods, limited edition drops.
- **Note:** If stock reaches 0, the item is automatically marked "Out of Stock".

### 2. PREORDER (Unlimited)

- **What it means:** You are taking orders first and producing/shipping later.
- **How it works:** The system accepts **Unlimited** orders. It does not track quantity.
- **When to use:** Group buys, digital products, or made-to-order items.

## How to Add a Product with Variants (Sizes/Colors)

Most products need options, like Size or Color. We call these "Variants".

1.  Go to **Admin > Products > Create New**.
2.  Fill in the basic info (Name, Price, Description).
    - _Tip: The price you enter here is the "Base Price"._
3.  Scroll down to **Variants**.
4.  Click **Add Variant**.
    - **Name:** e.g., "Size"
    - **Values:** e.g., "Small", "Medium", "Large", "XL"
5.  **Adjust Prices (Optional):**
    - If "XL" costs more, you can add `+50` to the price for that specific variant.
6.  **Set Stock:**
    - If you chose "STOCK" type, enter the quantity you have for _each_ size (e.g., 10 Small, 15 Medium).

## Organizing with Categories

Categories help customers find what they are looking for (e.g., "T-Shirts", "Stickers", "Sale").

1.  Go to **Admin > Categories**.
2.  Create your categories (e.g., "Apparel").
3.  When editing a product, simply select "Apparel" from the dropdown list.

## Common Questions

### Can I change a product from "Stock" to "Pre-order"?

Yes, but be careful! If you switch to "Pre-order", the system will stop tracking quantities and allow unlimited sales.

### How do I hide a product without deleting it?

Set the **Status** to "Inactive". The product will disappear from your store but remain in your admin dashboard for later.

### I made a mistake on a price. Will it change for old orders?

No. Updating a product's price only affects _new_ orders. Old orders will keep the price the customer originally paid.
