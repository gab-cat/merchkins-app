# Managing Order Batches

## What is a Batch?

A **Batch** is simply a group of orders collected over a specific time period. Think of it like a folder where you keep all orders from a specific week or month. This helps you organize your fulfillment process and track which orders need attention.

**Example Use Case:**
You can create a batch named "December Week 1" for all orders placed Dec 1-7. This lets you focus on packing and shipping just that group of orders.

## How to Create a Batch

1.  Go to **Admin > Batches**.
2.  Click **Create Batch**.
3.  Enter a **Batch Name** (e.g., "Holiday Sale - Batch 1").
4.  Select the **Start Date** and **End Date**.
5.  Click **Create**.

**What happens next?**
The system will automatically find all orders placed between those dates and add them to this batch. Any _new_ orders placed within that date range will also be added automatically.

## Bulk Actions (Update Many Orders at Once)

One of the best features of Batches is the ability to update many orders at the same time.

1.  Open your **Batch**.
2.  Select the orders you want to update (or click "Select All").
3.  Click **Update Status** or **Update Payment**.
4.  Choose the new status (e.g., mark all as "Processing").
5.  Confirm.

**Tip:** Before doing a bulk update, you can use the filters to select only specific orders (e.g., select only "Pending" orders to mark them as "Processing").

## Moving Orders Manually

Sometimes an order might fall outside your dates, but you still want to include it in a specific batch.

**To Add an Order:**

1.  Go to the **Order Detail** page of that order.
2.  Look for the **Batch Assignment** section.
3.  Click **Add to Batch** and select the batch you want.

**To Remove an Order:**

1.  Go to the **Order Detail** page.
2.  Click the **X** next to the batch name in the Batch Assignment section.

## Archiving Old Batches

When you are done with a batch (e.g., all orders are delivered), you can archive it to keep your list clean.

1.  Click the menu icon (**⋮**) on the batch.
2.  Select **Archive**.

This hides the batch from your main list but keeps the data safe if you ever need to look it up later.
