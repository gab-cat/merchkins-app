# Using the Support Ticket System

## Overview

Customers can submit "Tickets" when they have a problem (e.g., "My order is missing" or "I received the wrong size"). This system organizes all those complaints in one place so your team can handle them efficiently.

---

## Ticket Statuses: What do they mean?

- **OPEN:** A new ticket that needs your attention.
- **IN PROGRESS:** Someone on your team is currently working on it.
- **RESOLVED:** The issue is fixed.
- **CLOSED:** The ticket is finished and archived.

---

## Priority Levels

- **HIGH:** Use this for urgent issues like **Missing Payments**, **Lost Packages**, or **Angry Customers**.
- **MEDIUM:** Use this for standard questions like "When will this restock?"
- **LOW:** Use for feedback or minor suggestions.

## How to Reply to a Customer

1.  Go to **Admin > Tickets**.
2.  Click on an **OPEN** ticket to view the details.
3.  Scroll down to the **Comments** section.
4.  Type your reply.
    - _Note: Your reply will be visible to the customer._
5.  Click **Send**.

## How to Resolve a Ticket

Once you have solved the customer's problem (e.g., you issued a refund or answered their question):

1.  Open the ticket.
2.  Click **Update Status**.
3.  Select **RESOLVED**.
4.  Click **Save**.

If the customer confirms everything is good, you can then mark it as **CLOSED** to remove it from your active list.

## Assigning Tickets to Staff

If you have a team, you can assign specific tickets to them.

1.  Open the ticket.
2.  Look for the **Assignee** field.
3.  Select a staff member from the list.
4.  They will receive a notification that they have a new task.
