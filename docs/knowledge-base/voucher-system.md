## Types of Vouchers

### 1. Percentage Discount

Good for site-wide sales or specific collections.

- **Example:** "Get 10% off your first order"
- **How it works:** Deducts a percentage from the order total. You can set a **maximum discount limit** (e.g., 10% off up to ₱500) to protect your margins.

### 2. Fixed Amount Discount

Good for driving conversions with a clear monetary value.

- **Example:** "₱100 off when you spend ₱1,000"
- **How it works:** Deducts a fixed currency amount from the total. If the discount is higher than the order total, the order becomes free.

### 3. Free Item

Good for clearing inventory or introducing new products.

- **Example:** "Free Sticker Pack with every T-shirt"
- **How it works:** Automatically adds a specific item to the cart when the customer meets your conditions (like buying a specific product).

### 4. Refund Voucher

- **What is it?** When you approve a refund request, the system automatically creates this voucher for the customer.
- **How it works:** The customer receives a code equal to the refund amount. They can use this code to buy anything from any store on the platform.
- **Note for Sellers:** If a customer uses a Refund Voucher to buy from your store, **you still get paid the full amount** (minus the standard platform fee). The platform covers the cost of the voucher.

## Managing Your Vouchers

- **Disabling a Voucher:** You can stop a promotion anytime by finding the voucher in your list and clicking **Disable**. This prevents any new orders from using that code.
- **Tracking Usage:** Click on any voucher to see how many times it has been used and the total discount amount given.

## Common Questions

### What happens if a voucher covers the entire order amount?

If a discount makes the order total ₱0, the customer will not need to pay anything. The order is automatically marked as **PAID**.

### Can I limit a voucher to specific products?

Yes, when creating a voucher, you can choose to apply it only to specific products or categories.

### Can customers use multiple vouchers at once?

No, the system currently allows only one voucher code per order.

### Why did I receive an order paid with a "Refund Voucher"?

This means the customer used credit from a previous refund. Don't worry—this is treated like cash. You will receive your payout for this order just like any normal transaction.
