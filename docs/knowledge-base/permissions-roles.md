# Team Roles & Permissions

## Overview

You don't have to run your store alone. You can invite staff members to help you manage orders, products, or chats. The **Permissions System** lets you control exactly what each team member can see and do.

---

## The 4 Main Roles

### 1. Owner

- **Who is this?** The person who created the organization.
- **Access:** Everything.
- **Special Power:** Cannot be removed by anyone.

### 2. Admin

- **Best for:** Co-founders or Store Managers.
- **Access:** Almost everything the Owner can do. They can invite other members, manage settings, and view financials.

### 3. Staff

- **Best for:** Employees with specific jobs (e.g., Order Packer, Customer Support).
- **Access:** Limited. They can only do what you specifically allow them to do.

### 4. Member

- **Best for:** Interns or observers.
- **Access:** Read-only. They can view things but usually cannot make changes.

## Common Staff Roles (Examples)

Instead of confusing codes, think of permissions by "Job Title". Here is how you might set up common roles:

### The "Order Packer"

- **Goal:** Needs to see orders and mark them as packed/shipped.
- **Permissions to Give:** `Order Management` (Read & Update)
- **What they CAN'T do:** They cannot delete products or see your payout earnings.

### The "Product Manager"

- **Goal:** Needs to upload new items and update stock.
- **Permissions to Give:** `Product Management` (Create, Read, Update)
- **What they CAN'T do:** They cannot refund orders or change store settings.

### The "Support Agent"

- **Goal:** Needs to reply to customer questions.
- **Permissions to Give:** `Chat Management` or `Ticket Management`.
