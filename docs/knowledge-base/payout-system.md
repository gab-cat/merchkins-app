# Payout System Guide

## How Payouts Work

We value your business and want to make sure you get paid on time. Our system automatically calculates your earnings every week.

- **Payout Day:** Payments are processed every **Friday**.
- **Payout Period:** We calculate sales from **Wednesday (of the previous week)** to **Tuesday (of the current week)**.
- **Invoice Generation:** You will receive a payout invoice every **Wednesday** showing the details of what you'll be paid on Friday.

### Example Schedule

1.  **Sales Period:** You sell items from Wednesday, Dec 1st to Tuesday, Dec 7th.
2.  **Invoice:** On Wednesday, Dec 8th, you get an invoice for those sales.
3.  **Payment:** On Friday, Dec 10th, the money is transferred to your account.

## Your Earnings Calculation

Your payout is simple:
**Total Sales - Platform Fee = Your Payout**

- **Platform Fee:** The standard fee is **15%** of the order total. This covers payment processing and platform maintenance.
- **Refunds:** If an order is refunded _before_ payout, it's removed from the calculation. If it's refunded _after_ you've already been paid, the amount will be deducted (adjusted) from your _next_ payout.
- **Zero Balance:** If your Net Payout is **$0** (either due to no sales or adjustments balancing out sales), the invoice will be marked as **PAID** immediately.

### Viewing Your Invoices

1.  Go to **Admin > Payouts**.
2.  You will see a list of all your weekly invoices.
3.  Click on any invoice to download a PDF or view details.

## Understanding Adjustments

Sometimes, plans change. If an order is refunded after we've already paid you for it, you'll see an **Adjustment** on your next invoice.

- **Why does this happen?** To ensure fair accounting. Since you received money for an order that was later cancelled/refunded, we simply deduct that amount from your upcoming earnings.
- **What if the adjustment is larger than my payout?** If your adjustments exceed your earnings for the week, your payout will be **$0**. The remaining negative balance will be **carried over** to the next week's payout as a new adjustment.
- **Where to see it:** Check the **Adjustments** tab in the Payouts page to see a history of any deductions.

## Common Questions

### What if I don't set up my bank details?

Your invoices will still be generated, but **we cannot transfer the money** until you add your bank details. Once you add them, we will process any pending payments in the next cycle.

### Why is my payout lower than my total sales?

Remember that the **Platform Fee (15%)** is deducted from the total. Also, check if there were any **Adjustments** from previous refunds that reduced this week's payout.

### I see an order on Tuesday night, will it be in this week's payout?

The cut-off is strictly **Tuesday 11:59 PM (UTC)**. If the payment was confirmed _before_ this time, it's included. If it was confirmed _after_ midnight, it will be in next week's payout.
