## Tips for Better Announcements

- **Don't Overdo It:** Too many announcements can annoy customers. Use them only when important.
- **Keep it Short:** Customers are more likely to read short, catchy messages.
- **Use Buttons:** If you have a sale, add a link button so customers can go directly to the products.
- **Pin Important Stuff:** You can "Pin" an announcement to keep it at the top of the list, ensuring everyone sees it.
